    <h3>Donate to keep this extension alive.</h3>
    <p>Due to security measures UofT has in place, I host these videos so that people can download them. That isn't cheap, though. Due to finals last month causing a huge spike in usage, I ended up paying $60 to allow people to download their lectures and now I don't have the money to go buy the ingredients for the fried rice I wanted to make tonight.</p>
    <p>As it stands, I do not have enough money to keep this extension alive responsibly. However, there are 500 users of this extension. If everyone gave just 13 cents, that would be enough to pay for the cost of last month and probably also my fried rice cause that's pretty cheap. This is especially relevant to people in summer courses. So please, to keep this extension functional over the summer until we're back in person, donate a few bucks.</p>
